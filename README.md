# light-minded

Light-Minded is an interactive LED and fiber-optic brain sculpture. Participantsâ€™ inputs and responses to prompts are decoded into keywords that query a large database of neuroimaging studies, lighting up brain areas associated with these inputs to create a dynamic, colorful display of brain activity.
